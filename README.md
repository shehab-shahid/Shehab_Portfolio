# Shehab_Portfolio
Two projects till date

# [Mechanical Joint Simulation and Optimization](https://github.com/shehab-shahid/Mechanical_Joint_Simulation_Optimization)
* This is my undergrad thesis project from 2019 where I simulated a mechanical joint under load and optimized its stiffness to minimize internal stress
* The results of the gradient-based optimization algorithms amazed me and propelled my interest in digital technology
* Minimal coding was required in this project (loops, variables etc.) as optimization was built into the simulation software with its unique programming language (no MatLab or Python)
* Project repo contains theoretical information on how the objective function and optimization coefficients were formulated
* Below is a dashboard summarizing the project
