# Shehab_Portfolio
Two projects till date

# Mechanical Joint Simulation and Optimization
* This is my undergrad thesis project from 2019 where I simulated a mechanical joint under load and optimized its stiffness to minimize internal stress
* The results of the gradient-based optimization algorithms amazed me and propelled my interest in digital technology
* Minimal coding was required in this project (loops, variables etc.) as optimization was built into the simulation software (no MatLab or Python)
* Below is a dashboard summarizing the project
